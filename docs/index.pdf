0 -14 Td
(OpenVault is designed to mirror how cognition works, turning complex operations into a clear,) Tj
0 -14 Td
(navigable system.) Tj

(This Obsidian vault serves as the central nervous system for OpenClaw ? an AI orchestration) Tj
0 -14 Td
(platform that manages tasks, automations, and knowledge.) Tj

(architecture for how information flows, gets processed, stored, and acted upon. The UI design) Tj

(Architecture: Brain vs Body) Tj
0 -14 Td
(The system is split into two distinct locations. The Obsidian Vault is the brain ? it) Tj
0 -14 Td
(remembers, tracks, and documents rules and processes. The Projects folder is the body ? it) Tj

0 -14 Td
(Why Obsidian Vault?) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Keeping this system in Obsidian reduces cognitive load by making critical context easy to scan) Tj
0 -14 Td
(instead of repeatedly searching code repositories. Linked notes, graph relationships, and) Tj
0 -14 Td
(structured dashboards speed decisions by making dependencies visible at a glance for both) Tj
