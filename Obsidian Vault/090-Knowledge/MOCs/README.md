# Maps of Content (MOCs)

Index notes that link related concepts across the vault. Each MOC is a topic hub that connects knowledge notes, project references, bookmarks, decisions, and logs into a navigable map.

## How to Use
1. When a topic spans multiple notes/folders, create a MOC here
2. Link to specific notes, not folders — be precise
3. Update MOCs during weekly and monthly reviews
4. MOCs link to content; content links back to its MOC
